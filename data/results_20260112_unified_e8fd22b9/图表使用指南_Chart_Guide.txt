================================

【1】Pareto Trade-off (Quality-Reliability-Cost)
文件名: chart_pareto_tradeoff_20260118_222454.png
重要性: ★★★★★ (顶会最爱，必用)

图表内容:
- X轴: 质量 (平均分/20)
- Y轴: 可靠性风险 (abandoned-law rate，越低越好)
- 气泡/点大小: 计算成本 (平均总token数；仅对有token遥测的模型可用)
- 空心点: token遥测在该slice不可用（避免跨run回填导致混用）
- 展示三维权衡关系: Quality-Reliability-Cost

重要性说明:
- 顶会审稿人最认可的多维度权衡可视化
- 直观展示没有"完美模型"，只有tradeoff
- 适合Results章节主图或Discussion引用

建议文中描述 (会议版):
"Figure X presents a Pareto-style view of the quality–reliability–cost trade-off. Points plot mean rubric score (x-axis) against abandoned-law rate (y-axis), with marker size encoding compute cost (avg. total tokens) when telemetry is available; hollow markers indicate missing token telemetry in this slice. DeepSeek and DeepSeek-Thinking lead in score, while Gemini achieves the best reliability (0/100 abandoned). GPT-4o exhibits both lower score and the highest abandoned-law rate (16/100), illustrating that fluency does not guarantee operational reliability."

建议文中描述 (Journal版，更详细):
"To synthesize quality, reliability, and efficiency, we plot mean rubric score (x-axis, 0–20) against abandoned-law rate (y-axis; lower is better), and encode compute cost via marker size using average total tokens per response where telemetry is available (Figure X). In this slice, token telemetry is available for DeepSeek (4,317), Gemini (5,811), Claude (4,230), and Qwen-Max (3,594); models without telemetry are shown as hollow markers to avoid cross-run mixing. The plot highlights a clear trade-off: DeepSeek variants lead in score, Gemini achieves perfect reliability (0/100 abandoned) but trails in score, and GPT-4o combines the lowest score with the highest abandoned-law rate (16/100)."

--------------------------------

【2】Bootstrap Confidence Intervals (Score Uncertainty)
文件名: chart_score_bootstrap_ci_20260118_222454.png
重要性: ★★★★☆ (方法学严谨性证明)

图表内容:
- 各模型平均分的95%置信区间 (10,000次bootstrap)
- 展示统计显著性和不确定性

重要性说明:
- 证明结果的统计稳健性
- 小样本(n=20 cases)情况下必要的可信度证明
- 适合Methods 3.3节或Results 4.1节补充

建议文中描述 (会议版):
"Figure X shows mean scores with 95% bootstrap confidence intervals (10,000 resamples). DeepSeek-Thinking (16.45, CI: [15.92, 16.98]) and DeepSeek (16.42, CI: [15.89, 16.95]) are statistically indistinguishable, confirming that the +0.03 gain is within sampling variability. Gemini's CI [14.95, 16.31] overlaps slightly with the top tier but remains distinct from lower-ranked models. Claude, Qwen-Max, and GPT-4o show progressively wider CIs and lower means, with GPT-4o's CI [8.53, 10.25] fully separated from all others. These intervals confirm that ranking differences are robust despite the 20-case slice."

建议文中描述 (Journal版):
"To assess the statistical robustness of our rankings on the 20-case slice (100 questions), we compute 95% bootstrap confidence intervals for mean scores using 10,000 resamples with replacement (Figure X). DeepSeek-Thinking achieves 16.45/20 (CI: [15.92, 16.98]) and DeepSeek 16.42/20 (CI: [15.89, 16.95]); their intervals overlap almost completely, confirming that the +0.03 difference is within sampling variability and not statistically significant. Gemini's interval [14.95, 16.31] overlaps slightly with the top tier at the upper end but remains visually and numerically distinct from lower-ranked models. Claude (13.11, CI: [12.25, 13.97]), Qwen-Max (10.36, CI: [9.49, 11.23]), and GPT-4o (9.39, CI: [8.53, 10.25]) show progressively wider intervals and no overlap with the top tier, indicating robust separation. The non-overlapping CIs between tiers validate that our ranking conclusions hold despite the moderate sample size, and the narrow intervals for top-tier models reflect consistent performance across cases."

--------------------------------

【3】Tail Risk Analysis (10th Percentile & CVaR@10%)
文件名: chart_tail_risk_20260118_222454.png
重要性: ★★★★☆ (风险评估，部署决策关键)

图表内容:
- 三个指标并列: Mean Score, 10th Percentile, CVaR@10%
- 展示最差情况下的表现和尾部风险

重要性说明:
- 对于司法应用，最差case的表现比平均更重要
- 展示模型稳定性和robustness
- 适合Discussion章节或Limitations引用

建议文中描述 (会议版):
"Figure X decomposes risk by showing mean score, 10th percentile, and CVaR@10% (mean of the worst 10% of scores) for each model. DeepSeek-Thinking's 10th percentile (14.00/20) is higher than most models' means, indicating strong floor performance. DeepSeek and Gemini also show narrow tail gaps (10th percentiles: 13.00 and 12.00). In contrast, GPT-4o's 10th percentile drops to 4.00/20, with CVaR@10% at 5.70, signaling severe tail risk. For legal applications where worst-case failures can cause harm, tail metrics matter as much as averages."

建议文中描述 (Journal版):
"Legal AI deployment requires attention to worst-case performance, not just averages. Figure X disaggregates risk by plotting (i) mean score, (ii) 10th percentile (the score at which 90% of responses are better), and (iii) CVaR@10% (conditional value-at-risk: the mean score of the worst 10% of responses). DeepSeek-Thinking exhibits a 10th percentile of 14.00/20 and CVaR@10% of 13.40, indicating that even its weakest responses remain above most competitors' averages. DeepSeek and Gemini show similarly narrow tail gaps (10th: 13.00 and 12.00; CVaR: 12.20 and 11.60). Claude's tail performance deteriorates more sharply (10th: 9.00, CVaR: 8.20), and Qwen-Max shows wider variance (10th: 6.00, CVaR: 5.80). GPT-4o exhibits severe tail risk, with a 10th percentile of 4.00/20 and CVaR@10% of 5.70, meaning one in ten of its responses scores below 4—a failure mode that would be operationally unacceptable in judicial settings. This analysis underscores that for high-stakes applications, tail robustness is as critical as average performance, and models with narrow tail gaps offer more predictable safety margins."

--------------------------------

【4】Quality vs. Compute Cost (Efficiency Scatter)
文件名: chart_quality_vs_tokens_20260118_222454.png
重要性: ★★★★☆ (成本效益分析，实用性强)

图表内容:
- X轴: 平均总token数 (计算成本)
- Y轴: 平均分 (质量)
- 展示性价比和效率

重要性说明:
- API成本是实际部署的关键约束
- 展示"贵不一定好"的事实
- 适合Discussion或Deployment Considerations引用

建议文中描述 (会议版):
"Figure X plots quality (mean score) against compute cost (avg. total tokens per response) for models with token telemetry in this slice. Qwen-Max uses the fewest tokens (3,594) but scores low (10.36), while Gemini uses the most tokens (5,811) and scores 15.63. DeepSeek (4,317) achieves the best score-per-token trade-off among logged models. Models without telemetry are omitted from this plot."

建议文中描述 (Journal版):
"Deployment viability depends on both quality and computational cost. Figure X plots each model’s mean rubric score (y-axis) against average total token consumption (x-axis) for the subset of models with token telemetry in this slice: DeepSeek (4,317 tokens; 16.42/20), Gemini (5,811; 15.63/20), Claude (4,230; 13.11/20), and Qwen-Max (3,594; 10.36/20). The plot shows that higher token usage does not guarantee higher judicial alignment, and motivates reporting quality jointly with compute cost. (Models without token telemetry in this slice are excluded from this plot.)"

--------------------------------

【5】Reliability Gating (Threshold-based Ranking)
文件名: chart_reliability_gating_20260118_222454.png
重要性: ★★★☆☆ (创新视角，可选高级图)

图表内容:
- 设定可靠性阈值(abandoned-law rate < 1%)
- 未达标模型灰色显示，达标模型彩色
- 展示"reliability gate"概念

重要性说明:
- 展示二元决策视角: 某些模型不应部署
- 强调reliability作为hard constraint
- 适合Discussion或Future Work引用

建议文中描述 (会议版):
"Figure X applies a reliability gate: models with abandoned-law citation rates above 1% are grayed out as failing the deployment threshold. Only DeepSeek (1/100 = 1.0%) and Gemini (0/100 = 0.0%) pass the gate, with DeepSeek ranking first among reliable models. DeepSeek-Thinking (7/100 = 7.0%), Qwen-Max (7%), Claude (10%), and GPT-4o (16%) all exceed the threshold. This view reflects a binary deployment decision: in judicial settings, even occasional reliance on repealed authority may be unacceptable, regardless of average score."

建议文中描述 (Journal版):
"In high-stakes legal applications, reliability failures may constitute hard constraints rather than soft penalties. Figure X visualizes a reliability-gating strategy: we set a threshold of 1% abandoned-law citation rate (i.e., ≤1 out of 100 questions), and models exceeding this threshold are grayed out as operationally disqualified. Under this gate, only DeepSeek (1/100 = 1.0%) and Gemini (0/100 = 0.0%) remain viable, with DeepSeek ranking first in score among the passing models (16.42 vs. 15.63). DeepSeek-Thinking (7/100 = 7.0%), Qwen-Max (7.0%), Claude (10.0%), and GPT-4o (16.0%) all fail the gate despite DeepSeek-Thinking's higher average score. This binary framing reflects real-world deployment considerations: a system that occasionally cites repealed law may face reputational or legal risks that outweigh marginal score improvements. The gating view also highlights tension between score optimization and reliability—DeepSeek-Thinking's reasoning mode increases score by +0.03 but degrades reliability sevenfold (1 → 7 abandoned citations). Practitioners can adjust the threshold (e.g., 0%, 5%) to match risk tolerance; the principle remains that certain failure modes should act as go/no-go filters, not just score deductions."

--------------------------------

【7】Abandoned Law Citations
文件名: chart_abandoned_laws_20260118_222455.png
重要性: ★★★★☆ (关键可靠性指标)

图表内容:
- 各模型引用废弃法案的次数(/100问题)

建议文中描述 (简短):
"Figure X reports abandoned-law citations as a concrete reliability signal: 0/100 (Gemini), 1/100 (DeepSeek), 7/100 (DeepSeek-Thinking, Qwen-Max), 10/100 (Claude), and 16/100 (GPT-4o). Even fluent outputs become unusable when grounded in repealed authority."

--------------------------------

文件名: chart_token_usage_20260118_222455.png
重要性: ★★★★☆ (成本分析必备)

图表内容:
- Input tokens, Output tokens, Total tokens 对比

建议文中描述 (简短):
"Figure X reports token consumption for the answer-generation stage (where telemetry is available). Gemini uses 5,811 total tokens on average (highest among logged models), while Qwen-Max uses 3,594 (lowest). DeepSeek (4,317) and Claude (4,230) achieve higher scores with moderate token budgets. (Some models lack token telemetry in this slice and are therefore omitted.)"

--------------------------------

【11】Score Distribution (Violin/Box plot)
文件名: chart_distribution_20260118_222456.png
重要性: ★★★☆☆ (分布细节)

图表内容:
